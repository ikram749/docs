## FPX Bank Codes

To fetch the full list of banks and codes dynamically, call the **FPX Bank Listing API**:

```http
POST /fpx_bank_list
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic <client_id:client_secret>
The response contains a map of bank codes with their display name and availability:


{
  "banks": {
    "MB2U0227": {
      "name": "Maybank",
      "status": "online"
    },
    "CIMB0440": {
      "name": "CIMB Bank",
      "status": "offline"
    }
  }
}
Use the bankId (e.g. MB2U0227) as the payment_code in your payment request.
