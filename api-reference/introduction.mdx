# 🚀 SayabeliPay API Reference

Welcome to the **SayabeliPay API**.  
This API allows you to integrate payments, fetch bank listings, check transactions, and process refunds through the SayabeliPay payment gateway.

## 🔐 Authentication

The API uses **Basic Authentication** for all requests:

- **Username:** `client_id`  
- **Password:** `client_secret`  

Example header:

```http
Authorization: Basic <Base64(client_id:client_secret)>
Content-Type: application/json


🔑 Hash Signing (Payment API only)

For payment initiation requests, you must include a SHA-256 hash in the hash field of the request body.

The hash is generated by concatenating the following values in exact order:

clientSecret + customer_name + customer_email + customer_phone + order_no + amount + order_detail + paymentCode

If payment_code is provided → use it

Otherwise → fallback to channel

👉 See the Hash Generation Guide
 for examples in JavaScript, PHP, Java, and C#.
