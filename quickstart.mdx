## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication

All requests use **Basic Auth** with your **client_id** and **client_secret**:

```http
Authorization: Basic <Base64(client_id:client_secret)>
Content-Type: application/json

Example in curl:
curl -X POST https://api.sayabelipay.com/api/sandbox/fpx_bank_list \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-clientid:clientsecret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

  2Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Bank List (FPX)

curl -X POST https://api.sayabelipay.com/api/sandbox/fpx_bank_list \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-clientid:clientsecret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

  Sample response:

{
  "banks": {
    "MB2U0227": { "name": "Maybank", "status": "online" },
    "CIMB0440": { "name": "CIMB Bank", "status": "offline" }
  }
}

Use the bank code (MB2U0227) as the payment_code.
